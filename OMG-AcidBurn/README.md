# OMG Acid Burn

A script I put together to torment Call Center Scammers but can be used on your friends as well.. or Foes.

## Description

This program enumerates a target PC to include Operating System, RAM Capacity, Public IP, and Email associated with microsoft account.
The SSID and WiFi password of any current or previously connected to networks.
It determines the last day they changed thier password and how many days ago.
Once the information is gathered the script will pause until a mouse movement is detected
Then the script uses Sapi speak to roast their set up and lack of security
If wifi networks and passwords are detected wallpaper will be changed to image displaying that information
Image generated will be saved to desktop, steganography is used to put hidden message at bottom of binary output of image generated
